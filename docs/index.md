# Welcome to GhostMicro GhostPass
Documentation for the Next-Gen Mnemonic Serial Key Distribution System.

## Overview
GhostPass v8.1 is a human-centric serial key system that replaces cryptic traditional codes with a 12-word mnemonic phrase (GhostPass). Built on the 2048-word BIP-39 standard, it ensures high security while being easy for humans to read, remember, and record.

## Core Pillars
- **GhostPass Standard**: A structured 12-position mapping for licensing data.
- **2048-Word Dictionary**: Uses verified, unambiguous English words.
- **API-First Security**: Master Secret is hidden on the server, accessible only via API.
- **Built-in Security**: Word #12 acts as a dedicated Security Checksum (รปภ).

## Components
- **API Engine (Next.js)**: The headless hub for encoding and decoding requests.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive manuals for users and developers.
- **Integration Guide**: API reference for connecting external applications.
